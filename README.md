# Azure-SOC-Honeypot
Hands-on SOC project: Azure honeypot integrated with Sentinel, Defender for Endpoint and real attacker data analysis.

This project demonstrates a cloud-based Security Operations Center (SOC) lab that I designed and deployed using Microsoft Azure. The environment simulates real-world cyberattacks on a vulnerable Windows 10 honeypot, while integrating enterprise-grade security tools to detect, analyze, and respond to threats.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical, hands-on experience with:
	‚Ä¢	Threat detection and analysis using Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM).
	‚Ä¢	Endpoint protection and visibility with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE).
	‚Ä¢	Advanced event collection with Sysmon and Windows native logging.
	‚Ä¢	Offensive security simulation using Kali Linux for reconnaissance and attack testing.

‚∏ª

‚öôÔ∏è Lab Architecture
	‚Ä¢	Azure VM Honeypot (Windows 10) ‚Üí Intentionally exposed RDP service to attract brute-force attempts.
	‚Ä¢	Microsoft Sentinel ‚Üí Central SIEM for log ingestion, detection rules, and dashboards.
	‚Ä¢	Microsoft Defender for Endpoint ‚Üí EDR integration for behavioral detection and timeline analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Sysmon + Windows Logs ‚Üí Fine-grained event visibility (process creation, network connections, etc.).
	‚Ä¢	Kali Linux VM ‚Üí Used to simulate attacker reconnaissance and exploitation techniques.

‚∏ª

üîç Key Features
	‚Ä¢	Real Attacker Data ‚Üí Honeypot received 4,000+ brute-force login attempts, logged and analyzed in Sentinel.
	‚Ä¢	Custom Detection Rules ‚Üí Built KQL queries to detect:
	‚Ä¢	RDP brute-force attempts
	‚Ä¢	Malware execution from suspicious .exe files
	‚Ä¢	Geo-IP Threat Mapping ‚Üí Visualized attack origins across the globe.
	‚Ä¢	SOAR Playbooks ‚Üí Automated email alerts triggered by Sentinel analytic rules.

‚∏ª

üìä Screenshots & Evidence
	‚Ä¢	Sentinel dashboards (failed logins, attack timelines).
	‚Ä¢	Defender for Endpoint timeline analysis.
	‚Ä¢	KQL query outputs (detections).

‚∏ª

üöÄ Skills Demonstrated
	‚Ä¢	SIEM & SOC Operations ‚Üí Log ingestion, correlation, and detection engineering.
	‚Ä¢	Threat Hunting ‚Üí Identifying anomalous patterns such as beaconing intervals and brute-force campaigns.
	‚Ä¢	Incident Response ‚Üí Following escalation workflows for suspicious executables 
	‚Ä¢	EDR Usage ‚Üí Leveraging Defender for Endpoint for behavioral analysis.
	‚Ä¢	Red Team Awareness ‚Üí Conducting recon/attack simulations for blue team validation.
